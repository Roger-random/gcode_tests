(-----------------------------------)
(Machine configuration)
G18 (Select ZX plane matching TL-2)
G20 (Inch dimensions)
G40 (Cancel tool nose compensation)
G80 (Cancel any canned cycles)
G97 (Cancel constant suface speed)
G99 (Feed value is feed per rev)

(-----------------------------------)
(Startup)
G97 S300 M03 (Start spindle at RPM)

(-----------------------------------)
(Center drill to remove any nub left)
(from parting-off sphere and give a)
(good starting point for drilling)
(TODO: Use G82 spot drill cycle)
M97 P999 (Tool change position)
T331 (Center drill)
G54 (Work offset)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Starting position)
G01 X0. Z-0.1 F0.004 (Center drilling)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Pull back out of work)

(-----------------------------------)
(Drill stem hole 0.65" at deepest)
(Depth of full diameter is reduced)
(by angle of drill tip.)
(TODO: G81 drilling canned cycle)
(Or possibly G83 peck drilling)
G00 X0. Z1.0 (More Z to clear tip)
T332 (Stem hole drill)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Starting position)
G01 X0. Z-0.65 F0.004 (stem hole)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Pull back out of work)

(-----------------------------------)
(Drill cavity 0.25" at deepest)
(Depth of full diameter is reduced)
(by angle of drill tip.)
(TODO: G81 drilling canned cycle)
G00 X0. Z1.0 (More Z to clear tip)
T333 (Cavity hole drill)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Starting position)
G01 X0. Z-0.25 F0.004 (cavity)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Pull back out of work)

(-----------------------------------)
(Enlarge cavity with boring bar)
(Is this a job for G85 or another)
(canned cycle?)
G00 X0. Z1.0 (More Z to clear tip)
T334 (Boring bar)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Starting position)
(Look but don't cut until this is)
(figured out)
G00 X0. Z0.1 (Pull back out of work)

(-----------------------------------)
(Conclusion)
G97 S500 (Back to fixed RPM)
M97 P999 (Tool change position)
M05 (Spindle stop)
M30 (End of Program, rewind to start)

(-----------------------------------)
(Subroutine to tool change position)
N999 (Subroutine identifier)
(X is specific to stock diameter)
G54 G00 X1.5 Z8.
